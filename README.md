Simulating Gerrymandering with 'Lazy' voters.

Many factors like the political environment, funds of each party, stances of each candidates, etc. effect election results. 
In my election model, I have only considered two factors that effect the election - Gerrymandering and the ‘Lazy Voter’ effect. 

Gerrymandering is the act of redrawing state boundaries to change the election result of each state in such a way that the overall result of the election unfairly leans towards a particular party and is not representative of the political unit as a whole. 

The Lazy Voter effect is a phenomenon where a few voters are lazy and will not take the time out to go vote if in the last election their preferred party won with a landslide majority.
